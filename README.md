# improve-next-app
## About
I use this script to automate some configuration steps within my Next.js projects, and I thought it would be interesting to share the solution with other Linux users and Next.js developers.

## How to run?

## Step 1

```
git clone https://github.com/ArthurViniciusL/config-next-app
```
```
cd improve-next-app
```
```
chmod +x improve-config.sh
```

### Step 2

1. Go to your project folder next
2. Run script with:
```
./improve-config.sh
```
